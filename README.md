[**Unit Test Project**](https://github.com/stuycs-softdev/submissions/tree/master/7/intro-proj2/jstrauss-dtsui)  
*Partner*: Derek Tsui  
*Due Date*: Monday, 9/29  
*Description*: The idea of the test is to test if the function works as it's supposed to under some circumstance. In this case, we want to make sure that the valiate_password routine returns false if the password is too short and then again if it's too long. The idea is you're trying to systematically be able to test your code easily. If this were a real situation you might just have one test for password length.
