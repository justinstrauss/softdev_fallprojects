## Mini Projects

[**Intro Flask Project**] (https://github.com/stuycs-softdev/submissions/tree/master/7/intro-proj1/jstrauss_lakabas)  
Partner: Lev Akabas  
Due Date: Monday, 9/22  
Requirements:  
1. Have at least a couple of templates that use at least some Jinja substitutions  
2. Some form input  
3. Some styling -- you should use purecss, zurb foundation, twitter bootstrap or the like if you're not comfortable rolling your own.  

[**Unit Test Project**] (https://github.com/stuycs-softdev/submissions/tree/master/7/intro-proj2/jstrauss-dtsui)  
Partner: Derek Tsui  
Due Date: Monday, 9/29  
Description: The idea of the test is to test if the function works as it's supposed to under some circumstance. In this case, we want to make sure that the valiate_password routine returns false if the password is too short and then again if it's too long. The idea is you're trying to systematically be able to test your code easily. If this were a real situation you might just have one test for password length.
