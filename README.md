*Partners*: Leslie Bresnahan, Lise Ho, Victor Gaitour  
*Due Date*: Tuesday, 10/14 (Presented)  
*Clone*: `$git clone git@github.com:victorgaitour/Group3.git`  
*Description*: Write an app that can answer who and when questions such as "Who played Spiderman?" or "When was the umbrella invented?" Use google and beautifulsoup.  

[**SQLite Blog Engine**](https://github.com/justinstrauss/Group2sqlite)  
*Partners*: Leslie Bresnahan, Alex Libman, Albert Yeung  
*Due Date*: Wednesday, 10/22  
*Clone*: `$git clone git@github.com:justinstrauss/Group2sqlite.git`  
*Requirements*:  
  1. Index page: /  
This page will list the titles of all the posts and have a form where one can enter a new title and post. The title should be unique. If the user clicks on a title, it will take them to a "blog post page".  
  2. blog post page: /title  
This will take the user to an individual post. Use the <name> feature of flask for the routing. See the flask documentation if you don't remember this. This page will show the title and post as well as all the comments. There should be a form to add a new comment. There should also be a way to get back to the main page.  
  3. database stuff:  
You'll need a table for the posts with titles and posts and a table for comments where each comment will link to a post.  

[**API Project**](https://github.com/angela97lin/API_work)  
*Partner*: Angela Lin  
*Due Date*: Wednesday, 11/12 (Presented)  
*Clone*: `$git clone git@github.com:angela97lin/API_work.git`  
*Description*: Google Maps supports conventional public transit directions and biking directions, but it doesn't natively support getting directions that take Citibike station locations into consideration. Our app uses the Citibike and Google Maps APIs to calculate Citibike directions.  

## Mini Projects

[**Intro Flask Project**](https://github.com/stuycs-softdev/submissions/tree/master/7/intro-proj1/jstrauss_lakabas)  
*Partner*: Lev Akabas  
*Due Date*: Monday, 9/22  
*Requirements*:  
  1. Have at least a couple of templates that use at least some Jinja substitutions  
  2. Some form input  
  3. Some styling -- you should use purecss, zurb foundation, twitter bootstrap or the like if you're not comfortable rolling your own.  

[**Unit Test Project**](https://github.com/stuycs-softdev/submissions/tree/master/7/intro-proj2/jstrauss-dtsui)  
*Partner*: Derek Tsui  
*Due Date*: Monday, 9/29  
*Description*: The idea of the test is to test if the function works as it's supposed to under some circumstance. In this case, we want to make sure that the valiate_password routine returns false if the password is too short and then again if it's too long. The idea is you're trying to systematically be able to test your code easily. If this were a real situation you might just have one test for password length.
